## Project Overview

STEMLearn helps students learn Python through structured topics, personalized theory, adaptive questions, and feedback. The learning journey is built around 10 Python topics, each with 5 levels and increasing difficulty.

The platform connects programming concepts with hobbies such as cricket, football, badminton, gaming, music, cooking, and art so the learner can understand Python through familiar real-world situations.

Main goals:

- Teach Python concepts in a friendly, practical way.
- Use AI for theory, questions, feedback, and challenge conversations.
- Support multilingual learning without translating Python syntax.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install these before running the project:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- MongoDB local server or MongoDB Atlas URI
- Groq API keys
- Modern browser such as Chrome or Edge

---

## Environment Variables

Create a file at:

```text
server/.env
```

Recommended environment:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/stemlearn
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_secret

GROQ_KEY_1=your_theory_key
GROQ_KEY_2=your_question_key
GROQ_KEY_3=your_answer_feedback_key
GROQ_KEY_4=your_ai_challenge_key
```

Optional frontend environment:

```text
client/.env
```

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

If `VITE_API_URL` is not set, the frontend uses `http://localhost:5000/api` by default.

Important:

- Never commit `.env` files.
- `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`, `node_modules`, build output, logs, and local temp files.
- If sharing the project, provide `.env.example` instead of real keys.

---

## Running the App

---

## Application Flow

1. User opens the app.
2. User signs up, logs in, enters as guest, or uses Developer Testing Mode.
3. New users complete onboarding:
   - Choose language.
   - Choose hobby.
4. User reaches dashboard.
5. User opens a topic from the learning map.
6. AI theory is generated or loaded from cache.
7. User starts level practice.
8. Adaptive question engine serves questions.
9. User receives feedback and AI explanation.
10. Progress, points, streaks, weak spots, and badges update.
11. Advanced features unlock through progress or Developer Testing Mode.

---

## AI / Groq Key Roles

The backend intentionally uses four separate Groq clients. Each key has one job.

```text
GROQ_KEY_1 -> Theory generation only
GROQ_KEY_2 -> Question generation only
GROQ_KEY_3 -> Wrong-answer summary and IDE code review only
GROQ_KEY_4 -> AI Challenge only
```

This separation helps avoid one feature consuming the entire limit for every AI feature.

The current Groq model is configured in:

```text
server/config/groq.js
```

Current model:

```text
llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

AI prompt rules:

- Explanations follow the selected language.
- Python syntax remains in English.
- Python keywords remain in English.
- Variable names and function names remain unchanged.
- Code blocks are not translated.

---

## Frontend Routes

Main pages:

```text
/login
/signup
/onboarding
/home
/topic/:topicId
/daily-challenge
/challenge/:topicId
/boss-ai/:topicId
/leaderboard
/profile
/avatar
```

Route purpose:

- `/login`: Normal login, guest login, and Developer Testing Mode.
- `/signup`: Create account.
- `/onboarding`: Select language and hobby.
- `/home`: Dashboard and learning map.
- `/topic/:topicId`: Theory and adaptive practice.
- `/daily-challenge`: Slot-based daily challenge.
- `/challenge/:topicId`: AI interview challenge.
- `/boss-ai/:topicId`: Boss battle mode.
- `/leaderboard`: Ranking page.
- `/profile`: Stats, badges, avatar, weak spots, settings.
- `/avatar`: Avatar route kept for future avatar implementation.

---

## Backend API Routes

Backend routes are mounted in:

```text
server/server.js
```

Route groups:

```text
/api/auth
/api/topics
/api/progress
/api/groq
/api/leaderboard
/api/challenge
/api/profile
/api/streak
/api/badge
/api/health
```

Purpose:

- `auth`: signup, login, current user, developer login.
- `topics`: topic list, theory generation, detailed theory generation.
- `progress`: adaptive learning progress, weak spots, guest migration.
- `groq`: AI question generation, explanations, IDE checks, AI challenge.
- `leaderboard`: rankings.
- `challenge`: daily challenge status and completion.
- `profile`: profile updates.
- `streak`: daily streak updates.
- `badge`: badge checks.
- `health`: server health check.

---

## Learning System

Each topic has 5 levels.

Question types:

- MCQ
- Output prediction
- Fill in the blank
- Code challenge

Difficulty levels:

- EASY
- MEDIUM
- HARD

Adaptive behavior:

- Users answer questions in batches.
- MCQ and Fill batches use 5 questions.
- IDE/code batches use 3 questions.
- Passing a batch requires 60% accuracy.
- Passing EASY moves to MEDIUM.
- Passing MEDIUM moves to HARD.
- Passing HARD completes the level.
- Failing repeatedly can trigger detailed theory review.
- After theory review, difficulty decreases and fail count resets.
- Max question limits prevent infinite loops.

The adaptive engine is mainly handled by:

```text
client/src/components/question/QuestionEngine.jsx
server/routes/progress.js
server/utils/adaptive.js
```

---

## Daily Challenge System

Daily Challenges are topic-aware and based on the user's current topic.

The system supports 4 daily slots:

```text
00:00-05:59 -> Challenge 1
06:00-11:59 -> Challenge 2
12:00-17:59 -> Challenge 3
18:00-23:59 -> Challenge 4
```

Behavior:

- One challenge unlocks every 6 hours.
- A user cannot repeat the same completed slot.
- Slots reset on the next day.
- Developer Testing Mode bypasses cooldowns.
- Guest mode tracks slots locally.
- Normal users persist completions in the database.

Important files:

```text
client/src/assets/challenges/dailyChallenges.js
client/src/pages/DailyChallengePage.jsx
client/src/components/dashboard/DailyChallenge.jsx
client/src/utils/dailyChallengeSlots.js
server/routes/challenge.js
```

---

## Authentication Modes

## Git and Deployment Notes

This repository includes a root `.gitignore`.

Ignored items include:

- `node_modules`
- `.env`
- `.env.*`
- frontend build output
- logs
- local temp/cache files
- local database files
- editor files

Initial Git setup:

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Before pushing:

- Make sure no real API keys are committed.
- Make sure `server/.env` is ignored.
- Run `npm run build` in `client`.
- Start backend and check `/api/health`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend does not start

Run:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Check that port `3000` is free.

### Backend does not start

Run:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Check:

- `server/.env` exists.
- `MONGODB_URI` is correct.
- MongoDB is running.
- Port `5000` is free.

### AI features return fallback text

Check:

- `GROQ_KEY_1`
- `GROQ_KEY_2`
- `GROQ_KEY_3`
- `GROQ_KEY_4`
- Groq key limits
- Server logs

### Theory takes too long

Theory generation can take longer than normal requests because it asks for structured explanations with code examples. The client API timeout is configured higher for this reason.

### TTS does not speak a language clearly

The browser may not have a native voice installed for that language.

Try:

- Chrome or Edge
- Install OS voice packs
- Refresh the page after language change

### Piston code execution fails

The IDE uses the public Piston API:

```text
https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute
```

If it fails:

- Check internet connection.
- Check browser console.
- Try again after a few seconds.

---

## Current Status

The project is built for hackathon/demo usage with active features for learning, gamification, multilingual AI support, guest access, developer testing, and challenge-based practice.

For production deployment, recommended next steps are:

- Add automated tests.
- Add `.env.example`.
- Add rate limiting on AI routes.
- Add stronger production CORS rules.
- Add deployment-specific environment configuration.
- Add monitoring/logging for API failures.
